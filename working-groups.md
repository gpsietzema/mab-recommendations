## Goal of Recommendation
Actions have to be taken when a recommendation is approved in the MAB. This can be writing docs, designing, coding and discussing. These actions have a higher chance of succes if performed in groups. This recommendation describes how to form a 'Working Group' and how they work.

## Relevant Recommendations
None.

## Recommendation
### When is a Working Group needed?
A working group is advised when a recommendation effects all MODX users. This means that a working group is necessary for 99.9% of all recommendations.

#### Pros for Working Groups over individuals:
* Less risk of tunnel vision
* More resources available
* Faster implementation

The con is more paperwork and overhead, but the MAB feels the pros weigh heavier.

### Forming a Working Group
There are two ways a Working Group can be formed:
1. By asking MAB members after a successful vote
2. By inviting relevant non-MAB members to the Working Group after a successful MAB vote

When announcing accepted votes, the MAB (Vice) Chair should mention if a Working Group has been formed or that people are needed for in the Working Group. This will be **shared** on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Slack #announcements (no @channel!).

After a Working Group is formed, the group members should be **mentioned** in the Recommendation. This can only be done by the (Vice)Chair.

### Duties of a Working Group
The duty of a Working Group is simple: getting stuff done. This is the sole purpose of a Working Group. **If a Working Group fails to accomplish the goals of the source recommendation within 6 months after the Working Group founding date, it should be disbanded and the recommendation is handed back to the MAB.**

Therefore, the first duty of a Working Group is to review if the recommendation goals can be finished within 6 months. If they feel this is not realistic, new recommendations should be written with smaller goals in it. The original recommendation should be referenced to in the new recommendations.

Other duties of the Working Group:
- Share public meeting/progress notes in a folder within the MAB Google Drive folder. This can be done by **any MAB member**.
- Share links to these notes on Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook and Slack #announcements (no @channel!).
- Update the MAB about Working Group progress in every MAB meeting.
