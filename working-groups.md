# Working Groups

---

This recommendation describes the process of creating Working Groups to make approved recommendations reality.

* **Editor:** Gauke Pieter Sietzema
* **First published draft:** n/a
* **Accepted:** n/a

## Goal of Recommendation
Actions have to be taken when a recommendation is approved by the MAB. These actions can be writing docs, designing, coding and further discussions. These actions have a higher chance of success if performed in groups. This recommendation describes how to form a 'Working Group' and how they should work.

## Relevant Recommendations
None.

## Recommendation
### When is a Working Group advised?
A working group is advised when a recommendation effects all MODX users. This means that a working group is necessary for 99.9% of all recommendations.

#### Pros for Working Groups over individuals:
* Less risk of tunnel vision
* More resources available
* Faster implementation

The con is more paperwork and overhead, but the MAB feels the pros weigh heavier than the cons.

### Forming a Working Group
There are two ways a Working Group can be formed:
1. By asking MAB members after a successful vote
2. By inviting relevant non-MAB members to the Working Group after a successful MAB vote

This means there is always a minimum of 1 MAB-member in a Working Group.

When announcing accepted votes, the MAB (Vice) Chair should mention if a Working Group has been formed or that people are needed for in the Working Group. This will be **shared** on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Slack #announcements (no @channel mention please).

After a Working Group is formed, the group members should be **mentioned** in the Recommendation. This can only be done by the (Vice)Chair.

### Duties of a Working Group
The duty of a Working Group is simple: getting stuff done. This is the sole purpose of a Working Group. **If a Working Group fails to accomplish the recommendation goals within 6 months after the Working Group founding date, it should be disbanded and the recommendation is handed back to the MAB which can form a new Working Group or revise the recommendation.** 

Therefore, the first duty of a Working Group is to review if the recommendation goals can be finished within 6 months. If they feel this is not realistic, new recommendations should be written with smaller sub-goals. The original recommendation should be referenced to in the new recommendation(s).

Other duties of the Working Group:
- Share public meeting/progress notes in a folder within the MAB Google Drive folder. This can be done by any Working Group member.
- Share links to these notes on Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook and Slack #announcements (no @channel notices please).
- Update the MAB about Working Group progress in every MAB meeting.
- Supply the MAB with roadmap-adjustments. The Working Group activities should be added to the Roadmap, if the activities are code/design/accessibility related.

## How does the Working Group communicate?
- Meeting notes are shared in a Public Google Drive folder, within the MAB-folder. If a modx.org community-driven project-website is launched, the notes will be published there and the Google Drive folder will be deprecated.
- Code will be in Github, with one branch with Working Group name within it. PR's will be done to that branch by Working Group-members.
- (Private) Discussions happen in a private Slack-channel on the MODX Community Slack. Public discussions can happen on Github in the designated MAB-projects.
