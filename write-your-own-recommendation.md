# Write your own recommendation
Do you have an idea to improve MODX and do you want to collaborate with the MODX community to get it done? Then this is the place to be!

This Github repository was created for the community by the MODX Advisory Board (MAB) to offer a public venue for insight into recommendations to be voted on the MODX roadmap. The roadmap will help all MODX contributors to bundle their efforts on these recommendations and help MODX move forward faster.

Every recommendation should be sponsored by a MAB board member, who will help you write a valid recommendation to be voted on.

Here are some quick steps to get you started:

1. Check our the current recommendations first. Your idea might already be listed
2. Read the [recommendation specifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aRId889oHBxnUB4kYpToNJsA9_IJfXqvuw0hw32MIU)
3. Read the [voting protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZX5QBhIZNKnD3ammCzmEdR3uFlHXPo-nT4D9DUeaxkk), so you know how the process works
3. Ask your [favourite MAB member](https://modx.com/community/modx-advisory-board/mab-members) to sponsor your recommendation
4. Start writing!
