# Extras Repository
---

An improved home for quality MODX Extras, introducing automated and user-generated quality checks, relevant Extra information and Github integration.

* **Editor:** Gauke Pieter Sietzema
* **First published draft:** t.b.d.
* **Accepted:** Not yet voted.

## Goal of Recommendation

The current extras repository is of age and behaves like that. Compared to competitive CMS repositories it misses essential features and development is stagnating.

Besides the above, the quality of the current extras and the listings of those extras is limited. Therefore quality standards should be implemented to guarantee better quality. If an extra fails to meet these standards, it is rejected.

This recommendation aims to start off with an improved Extras repository, define quality standards, define possible future improvements and making sure future development is easier and not limited to modx.com maintainers.

MODX.COM/EXTRAS
Please share all your ideas/improvements for https://modx.com/extras/ in here.

- Include link to the code repository (GitHub, Bitbucket etc) [Chris]
- Include link to documentation page [Chris]
- Show number of downloads during last 30 days instead of total download count, since that should be a much more interesting metric (that’s “still actively used extras) [Chris]
- Get rid of RTE and use markdown for descriptions [Chris]
- Allow to specify an external changelog file (e.g. from Github) [Chris]
- Allow developers to ask for maintainers/mark an extra as not maintained [Romain]
- Allow multiple people to handle new builds [Romain]
- API to handle packages (& versions) [Romain]
- Allow commercial addons to be added with a buy-now link (+affiliate link for some extra modx.com income) [GP]
- Allow ratings for extras per release [GP]
- Last update / release date in overview [GP]
- Automatic listing-quality checking [GP]
- Better author profiles / multiple authors [GP]
- Related extras / dependencies / requirements [GP]
- List and/or filter by element types, e.g. Snippet, Plugin, Core, Chunks, TVs, etc. [MJ]
- Better Tagging [Thomas]
- The description & changelog inside of the package could be used for autofill the extra description [Thomas]
- No beta versions available (if someone wants to publish something in extras -> publish a release version -> at least say with the name that it is ready for production) [Thomas]
- Beta release channel that has to be switched on in the MODX backend to download beta versions [Thomas]
